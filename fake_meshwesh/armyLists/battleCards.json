The army list indicates which bow-armed troops may be used to support other troops (labeled Supporting Bowmen) and which troops may be supported (labeled Supportable).\n\nIf used, the Supporting Bowmen battle card must be used in one of two ways.\n\n*Option 1*\n\nThe Supporting Bowmen battle card must be applied to all stands in a Supportable troop entry if applied to any (i.e., all or none). If there aren’t enough stands of Supporting Bowmen available to support all Supportable stands, then the battle card may not be used.\n\n*Option 2*\n\nThe  Supporting Bowmen battle card may be applied to any number of stands in a Supportable troop entry. If this option is selected, every stand that has the Supporting Bowmen battle card applied to it must be replaced at deployment by a stand modeled with supporting bow figures.  If these separate stands are not available (and visually distinct from unsupported stands) this option is not allowed.\n\nThese options are selected separately for each eligible troop entry.\n\n#### Cost\nThere is no cost for the battle card itself. However, one or more Supporting Bowmen stands (which are included in the total army cost) must be exchanged for the addition of support to the Supportable stands. \n\n#### Deployment\nDuring deployment, the player may set aside Supporting Bowmen stands in exchange for adding support to the Supportable stands in the army. One stand of Supporting Bowmen can support as many Supportable stands as the point value of its troop type. \n\nThe decision to use the battle card must be made when the first supported troops are placed on the game board. Supporting Bowmen stands that have been placed on the game board may not be exchanged.\n\nThe Supporting Bowmen stands set aside are not used during the game and do not count as lost.\n\n*Example*\n\nA player assembles an army that has 6 stands of Heavy Foot that are Supportable. The Supporting Bowmen stands are Skirmishers (3 points per stand). To add support to the heavy foot stands, the player would need to include 2 Skirmishers stands in the army, which would be exchanged (set aside) during deployment to add support to the Heavy Foot.\n\n#### Modeling\nNo changes are required if the battle card is used “all or none” – i.e., if the choice of whether to use Supporting Bowmen or not is made for all Supportable troops at deployment.\n\nIf the player wishes the option of using only some Supportable troop stands with Supporting Bowmen, each such stand (a “Supported” stand) is modeled with the same number and type of figures as a regular stand, plus one supporting bow figure standing behind the line of figures.  This Supported stand should be on the same depth base if possible.\n\nUse of Supported stands modeled as described allows the player to vary from the “all or none” choice at deployment – to deploy some Supportable stands with Supporting Bowmen and some without – but does not modify the battle card in any other way.  A single Skirmisher (3pt stand) could be exchanged for providing support for three individual Supported stands, for example.\n\n#### Game Play\nStands which are supported by Supporting Bowmen receive a +1 tactical factor in close combat against enemy Warband, Warriors, and all mounted troop types. This tactical factor only applies if the stand is fighting to its front.\n\n#### Victory Conditions\nIf destroyed, a stand that has the Supporting Bowmen battle card counts as its normal number of points of lost troops. The Supporting Bowmen battle card does not change this value.\n\n#### Historical Background\nA number of armies throughout history have reacted to horsemen (and in some cases fierce infantry) by using a thin line of bowmen to support behind the main line of foot.  This line of missile troops substantially increased the effectiveness of supported foot by galling the enemy and endangering them while they were still preparing to engage.\n\nSuch supporting bowmen could also be used separately from the other foot troops, grouped together as a unit.

The choice is made when each stand is deployed.\n\n#### Modeling\nA Mobile Infantry stand representing the infantry and its transports must be mounted using a square base (i.e., one which has the same depth as its width)\n\n#### Game Play\n*Tactical Movement*\n\nA Mobile Infantry stand on its transport  is an open order stand, regardless of whether it is open order or close order without its transport.  It has a tactical move distance of 6 MU, reduced to 3 MU if any part of their move is in or through difficult terrain.\n\nWhen making a tactical move, a Mobile Infantry stand may not move within 4 MU of any enemy stand or camp. A Mobile Infantry stand that starts within 4 MU of an enemy stand may make a tactical move to discard its transports without moving.  \n\n*Discarding Transports*\n\nWhen making a tactical move, a Mobile Infantry stand may end its move by discarding its transports.  This exchanges the Mobile Infantry stand for a stand of its normal troop type. When discarding its transports, place the normal troop type stand such that its front edge is in the same location and orientation as the front edge of the Mounted Infantry stand. A stand may discard its transports at the end of any kind of tactical move, including a single stand move, a group or column move, or a flank march.\n\nAny exchange of a Mobile Infantry stand for its native foot stand places the foot stand so the front edge is unchanged.  If the Mobile Infantry stand is part of a column or group, this exchange does not modify the position of any other stands in the column or group, even if this creates gaps in the column or group.\n\nOnce transports are discarded a Mobile Infantry stand is treated as its normal troop type for the remainder of the game.\n\nTransports may not be recovered during a battle. Normal troop type stands, whether deployed as the normal troop type or having discarded their transports, may not be exchanged for a Mobile Infantry stand.\n\n*Ranged Combat*\n\nMobile Infantry stands may not shoot during the ranged combat phase but may be shot at. If shot at, they use the combat factor for their normal troop type but receive a -1 tactical factor for being on transports.  If a Mobile Infantry stand is beaten in ranged combat, it must complete any required outcome move and, if not destroyed, immediately discard its transports (as described above).\n\nA stand which discarded its transports during the tactical movement phase may shoot during the ranged combat phase if it meets the standard ranged combat eligibility rules.  If it was forced to discard its transports as a result of losing a ranged combat roll, it may not shoot in the remaining part of the ranged combat phase.\n\n*Close Combat*\nAn enemy stand may move into contact with a Mobile Infantry stand and engage in close combat.  When the close combat is rolled, the Mobile Infantry stand with transports loses its transports (is replaced with its foot type) and receives a -1 tactical factor in that combat for being attacked while on its transports.\n\n#### Historical Background\nThis battle card represents troops who sometimes began battles with additional transports to gain increased mobility, but always fought as infantry.  Such infantry were not trained to fight mounted, but gained significant mobility while being conveyed.\n\nSome examples of armies from history that used this ability were archers of the later Hundred Years War English, Kallapani of the Assyrians and Neo-Elamites, Kyrenean Greek hoplites riding on carts, and many others.\n","id":"61490b11315ef3001640ff3a","htmlText":"<p>Troops with this battle card represent infantry who increase their initial mobility by starting the battle mounted on carts, mules, camels, or horses.

The choice is made when each stand is deployed.</p>\n<h4>Modeling</h4>\n<p>A Mobile Infantry stand representing the infantry and its transports must be mounted using a square base (i.e., one which has the same depth as its width)</p>\n<h4>Game Play</h4>\n<p><em>Tactical Movement</em></p>\n<p>A Mobile Infantry stand on its transport  is an open order stand, regardless of whether it is open order or close order without its transport.  It has a tactical move distance of 6 MU, reduced to 3 MU if any part of their move is in or through difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>When making a tactical move, a Mobile Infantry stand may not move within 4 MU of any enemy stand or camp. A Mobile Infantry stand that starts within 4 MU of an enemy stand may make a tactical move to discard its transports without moving.  </p>\n<p><em>Discarding Transports</em></p>\n<p>When making a tactical move, a Mobile Infantry stand may end its move by discarding its transports.  This exchanges the Mobile Infantry stand for a stand of its normal troop type. When discarding its transports, place the normal troop type stand such that its front edge is in the same location and orientation as the front edge of the Mounted Infantry stand. A stand may discard its transports at the end of any kind of tactical move, including a single stand move, a group or column move, or a flank march.</p>\n<p>Any exchange of a Mobile Infantry stand for its native foot stand places the foot stand so the front edge is unchanged.  If the Mobile Infantry stand is part of a column or group, this exchange does not modify the position of any other stands in the column or group, even if this creates gaps in the column or group.</p>\n<p>Once transports are discarded a Mobile Infantry stand is treated as its normal troop type for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>Transports may not be recovered during a battle. Normal troop type stands, whether deployed as the normal troop type or having discarded their transports, may not be exchanged for a Mobile Infantry stand.</p>\n<p><em>Ranged Combat</em></p>\n<p>Mobile Infantry stands may not shoot during the ranged combat phase but may be shot at. If shot at, they use the combat factor for their normal troop type but receive a -1 tactical factor for being on transports.  If a Mobile Infantry stand is beaten in ranged combat, it must complete any required outcome move and, if not destroyed, immediately discard its transports (as described above).</p>\n<p>A stand which discarded its transports during the tactical movement phase may shoot during the ranged combat phase if it meets the standard ranged combat eligibility rules.  If it was forced to discard its transports as a result of losing a ranged combat roll, it may not shoot in the remaining part of the ranged combat phase.</p>\n<p><em>Close Combat</em>\nAn enemy stand may move into contact with a Mobile Infantry stand and engage in close combat.  When the close combat is rolled, the Mobile Infantry stand with transports loses its transports (is replaced with its foot type) and receives a -1 tactical factor in that combat for being attacked while on its transports.</p>\n<h4>Historical Background</h4>\n<p>This battle card represents troops who sometimes began battles with additional transports to gain increased mobility, but always fought as infantry.  Such infantry were not trained to fight mounted, but gained significant mobility while being conveyed.</p>\n<p>Some examples of armies from history that used this ability were archers of the later Hundred Years War English, Kallapani of the Assyrians and Neo-Elamites, Kyrenean Greek hoplites riding on carts, and many others.</p>\n"},{"permanentCode":"ES","displayName":"Elephant Screen","importName":"Elephant Screen","category":"troop","showInList":true,"listName":"Elephant Screen","mdText":"Armies with this battle card may disperse elephants across other troops as a screen.\n\n#### Selecting this Battle Card\nThe army list indicates if the Elephant Screen battle card is available to an army.

In some cases, enemy horses were unwilling to get too close to camels.

This includes using non-combatants who are intended to appear as if they were real troops and disguising certain troops to appear as if they were a different kind of fighting troop.\n\nDeceptive Deployment involves placing one or more fake (masquerade) stands during the deployment phase; when certain conditions are met the masquerade stands are removed or exchanged.\n\n#### Selecting this Battle Card\nThe army list indicates if the Deceptive Deployment battle card may be purchased. Non-combatants disguised to look like fighting troops will have a Deceptive Deployment battle card listed for the army itself. Troops which may be disguised as another troop type will have a Deceptive Deployment battle card for the applicable troop entry.\n\nThe army list specifies what troop type to use for the masquerade stands, and what troop type they are replaced with (if any) once their deception is revealed.\n\n#### Cost\nThe battle card costs 1 point for each potential removal or exchange:\n- Non-combatants that are disguised as a single troop stand cost 1 point\n- One stand of troops that is disguised as a single troop stand costs 1 point\n- Two stands of troops that are disguised as a single stand cost 1 point\n- One stand of troops that is disguised as two stands costs 1 point\n\nAll other costs are calculated using the cost of the actual troop stands that are in the army.\n\nFor example, a stand of Horde that is disguised as two stands of Pike has a total cost of 3 points (2 points for the stand of Horde and 1 point for the Deceptive Deployment battle card). Two stands of Warriors that are disguised as a single stand of Horde have a total cost of 7 points (6 points for the two stands of Warriors and 1 point for the battle card). Non-combatants that are disguised as a single stand of Horde have a cost of just 1 point (1 point for the battle card).\n\n#### Deployment\nMasquerade stands are placed during deployment as if they were the stands of the troop type that they appear to be. For example, Warriors disguised as Horde are deployed as if they were really Horde.\n\n#### Modeling\nDeceptive Deployment masquerade stands should appear in every way as a normal troop stand of the type specified in the army list.  When deploying the masquerade stand, it should be marked in some way not visible to the opposing player.  One convenient way to do that would be using a simple sticker on the bottom of the troop stand to designate which of the normal troop stands is actually the masquerade stand. \n\n#### Game Play\nWhile masquerade stands are in play they are treated in all respects as the troop type they are disguised as, except as below.\n\nThe masquerade stand cannot move more than 4 MU (if it is masquerading as a mounted troop type) or 2 MU (if it is masquerading as a foot troop type).\n\nAt any point during their tactical movement phase a player may remove or exchange (as appropriate) a masquerade stand. This action is not considered a tactical move and does not cost any command points.\n\nRemove or exchange a masquerade stand at the end of any tactical movement phase if it is within 8 MU of an enemy stand.\n\nIf one stand of troops is disguised as two stands of troops (e.g., a stand of Horde that is disguised as two stands of Pike), the two masquerade stands must be deployed and moved together, with one stand directly behind the other.\n\n*Removing a Masquerade Stand*\n\nWhen revealed, a masquerade stand that represents non-combatants is simply removed from the table. \n\nIf the masquerade stand is part of a column or group, removing the stand does not modify the position of any other stands in the column or group, even if this creates gaps in the column or group.\n\n*Exchanging Masquerade Stands*\n\nWhen revealed, masquerade stands that represent troops disguised as another troop type are exchanged for the actual troop stands.\n\nWhen exchanging a masquerade stand, place the actual troop stand such that its front edge is in the same location and orientation as the front edge of the masquerade stand. \n\nIf the masquerade stand is part of a column or group, this exchange does not modify the position of any other stands in the column or group, even if this creates gaps in the column or group.\n\nIf two stands of troops are disguised as a single stand, exchange the masquerade stand for the two actual stands by placing one stand such that its front edge is in the same location and orientation as the front edge of the masquerade stand and placing the second stand directly behind the first.\n\n#### Historical Background\nThis unusual battle card crops up in a variety of circumstances.  The Murong Xianbei used a bunch of women on oxen to ride around and spread dust from bags in the air to simulate the movement of unknown forces and trick their enemies.  Both Pompey and Caesar had groups of camp followers on nags riding around to deceive enemies into believing they had larger forces of cavalry than they actually did.  Agathokles of Syracuse, fighting in Africa, took camp followers and rowers and equipped them to simulate hoplites.  In a battle in 590 AD a group of fierce Saxon warriors were given Breton clothing and even Breton haircuts to gain an advantage by misleading the Carolingian Franks into thinking they were poor Breton foot.  Other examples abound.\n","id":"61490b11315ef3001640ff47","htmlText":"<p>Armies with this battle card used unusual methods to deceive enemies with respect to how their army had deployed for battle.
